This repository is a structured archive of my explorations in **Pattern Recognition**.  
It covers foundational techniques in image analysis and dimensionality reduction, along with practical implementations from scratch in Python.

</p>

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by topic, with each notebook focusing on a specific concept.  
Current contents include:

1. **Edge Detection** – Basic techniques to detect edges in images.  
2. **Canny Edge Detection** – Multi-stage edge detection algorithm with noise reduction.  
3. **Boundary Detection using Contour Tracing** – Identifying object boundaries in binary images.  
4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** – Dimensionality reduction for high-dimensional datasets.  
5. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** – Supervised dimensionality reduction and classification.  

Additional files include sample images, outputs, and supporting visuals for experiments.

## Motivation

The goal of this repository is to:
- Recreate fundamental **pattern recognition algorithms** from scratch.  
- Understand *why* and *how* each technique works.  
- Build a reference that connects **theory with practical implementations**.  

This serves as a resource for myself and others who want a hands-on approach to mastering pattern recognition.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python  
- NumPy  
- OpenCV  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebooks  

## How to Use

- Clone the repository.  
- Navigate to the notebook corresponding to the topic you want to learn.  
- Each notebook is well-commented and includes step-by-step code.  
- Experiment with different parameters and images to deepen understanding.

More methods (like clustering, classification, and advanced feature extraction) will be added as the project grows.
